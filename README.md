## Installation

Free proxy on Extension: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/purpleadblock/) and [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/purple-adblock/lkgcfobnmghhbhgekffaadadhmeoindg).

Does not work with Alternate Player for Twitch.tv, or another "twitch adblocker". But you can use generic adblockers like "uBlock Origin".

### User Tunnel only 
The Purple get a direct request withot ads flow from the proxy.

### Tunnel and Local requests - BETA
Purple takes a request with no ad stream from the server and a local request and just calls the proxy stream when ads show. doing so a mix of the stream. Avoiding Bufferring problem in sames connection.
it is on beta. i am making the script to do as generic as possible. You can help sending pull requests if you now code :)
