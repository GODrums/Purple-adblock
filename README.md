# About the project
An adblocker for the "purple website" using server side signature.

Please help us develop the extension by donating and reporting bugs. [Discord](https://discord.gg/7MpUUDNxHx)

## Installation

Download the extension here for: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/purpleadblock/) or [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/purple-adblock/lkgcfobnmghhbhgekffaadadhmeoindg).

It doesn't work with "Alternate Player for Twitch.tv", or other "twitch adblockers". But you can use generic ad blockers like "uBlock Origin".

### Only user tunnel
The Purple adblock gets a direct request without ads from the proxy.

### Tunnel and local requests - BETA
Purple plays your countries stream and just calls the proxy stream when ads show. doing a mix of the streams. therefore avoiding buffering problems in the same connection.
It is in beta. I am making the script as generic to do as possible. You can help by sending pull requests if you can write code :)

## Development
If you wanna build your own server, just run the NodeJS server and change the host on .ts file.
